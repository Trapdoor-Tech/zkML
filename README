1. Our project is an online trading system aiming to trade ETH/USDT.

2. Our model is used to predicate the ETH price to determine BUY/SELL operations.

3. We use ZeroKnowledge Proof to protect the high accurate model(maybe say 99%), and 
   show the predication used by decisions actually produced by the claimed high accurate
   model.
